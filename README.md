# Factor-analysis
Unsupervised Learning Algorithm.
Factor analysis is used for Data reduction and summarization.
It is a interdependence technique.
In this code i have used PCA(Prinicipal Component Analysis).
PCA is an extraction method, which extracts number of variables into number of factors based on Eigen Value.
If Eigen value is > 1,only those variables can be extracted to factor.
